Google Chrome extension that uses Anthropic API calls to provide translation, definition, or explanation of highlighted text.

⚠️ Security Notice ⚠️
* This extension makes API calls directly from your browser, which requires a "dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true" flag
* Your API key is stored in Chrome's local storage
* I am not fully aware of the security flaws of this, but if someone has access to Chrome on your machine they probably have access to your API key
